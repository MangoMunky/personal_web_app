                    <h3>My Work</h3>
                    <p>I started coding around 2021 during the pandemic, but I didn't really do any real projects past tutorials
                        until around 2022. Around this time I started experimenting with Project Eulur which helped me more than any
                        tutorial had so far. I made the first few projects using python That summer I got ambitious and decided to
                        enroll in Harvards free online computer science course CS50. I completed the first 4 weeks. During this time
                        I learnt to code in C and designed a credit card validator. However, got pretty burnt out. So I decided to
                        take a break, until I took computer science the next year and participated in the Waterloo Coding Contest.
                        This year I also took a computer science class and participated in the waterloo coding contest.</p>

                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>I am currently a highschooler attending western technical commercial school and am in the robotics SHSM. I
                        like to learn about a large variety of things, such as 3d modeling, nutrition, plants, programming and
                        others. In the future, I see myself creating hardware to aid the growth of plants for home and commercial
                        use from self taught experimenting.</p>
